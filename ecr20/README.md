# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
## Show Help
npx hardhat help

## Run test
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

## Deploy
npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts

npx hardhat node
```
